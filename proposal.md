# Shadow Forge

## Description
This program will take an image and detect its shadows, which will then be utilized in a variety of ways to create stylized versions of that image. Artists will be able to better visualize the contrast within their image as well as quickly generate cool art.

## Features
- Feature 1: Find and hightlight shadows.
	- This code will take an image, translate it into greyscale, and highlight the pixels that fall within a prescribed saturation range.
- Feature 2: Modify the shadows into different styles.
	- This code will loop through the shadow-generated shapes and use different libraries to modify color, filling, outline, etc.
- Feature 3: Animate the process.
	- This code will display the process so the viewer can see the image as it is being generated.

## Challenges
- I will need to research different 3rd-party packages to modify pixels in a variety of ways.
- I will need to figure out how to animate the process of the code.
- I will need to experiment with having the program detect an outline of a shape.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The program can take an image, finds its shadows, modify the shadows into at least three different styles, and display the art as it is being generated.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- The program can take an image, finds its shadows, and modify the shadows into one different style.

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Find an image's shadows
  2. Isolate shadows

- Week 2
  1. Modify shadow into one style
  2. Establish minimal viable outcome

- Week 3
  1. Modify shadow into another feature
  2. Modify shadow into third feature

- Week N (Final)
  1. Animate process
  2. Optimize code
