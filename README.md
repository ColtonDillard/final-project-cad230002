## Description
When learning to draw or paint, artists must understand the fundamentals of how light creates an object's shadow and how that shadow affects the object's shape. Shadow Forge is built to help artists take any image and highlight its darker areas, making it easier for the artist to understand the image's composition. But why stop there? Shadow Forge also utilizes this tool to create stylistic versions of the image, making it easy to create cool art with real images. 
    
There is a range of shadow that the user can choose from, depending on how dark and detailed the user wants the image to be. Simply using the given slider, the user can choose anywhere from 0 to 255, going from no shadow to complete shadow. After determining the amount of shadow, the user has a variety of images to save. Besides the shadowed image, the program also creates a simple greyscale version, a version with outlined shadows, and a version with randomly colored pixels filling the shadows. 

The files within my project contain the code itself as well as four images used for testing and demonstrating. Currently the code can take in png images. For future improvement, the program could be adjusted to take in more file formats as well as run in a more optimized manner. Although the gui for the current version is sufficient, future versions could have a more aesthetic appeal in the ui design.

With all that said, I am excited about Shadow Forge, and I believe it can be well utilized to study images as well as enjoy them in a different light (or should I say "shadow").
